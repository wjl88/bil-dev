<p>We were coming up on the last couple weeks before the Fall Open Studio Event. Since there was no sale at <a href="https://www.stickermule.com/">Sticker Mule</a> I decided to browse available sticker materials. The glitter (as opposed to the holographic) backing made me think about the static on an old CRT screen.</p>

<p>I hopped into stable diffusion and began trying out different prompts for retro computers. I was looking for an Apple II aesthetic. A style that ended up working incorporated "8-bit" and "pixel graphics".</p>

<p>The image was worked up in GIMP. Colors were saturated and then run through a pixel filter. The screen portion and the background of the image were removed leaving only transparency where the sticker backing would be visible (i.e. static on the display).</p>

<p>A single letter M was rendered in yellow on the center of the display to mimic the Milstein Program logo.</p>



<p>50 stickers were ordered for the event at 2 in x 2 in.</p>
